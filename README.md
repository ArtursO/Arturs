My name is **Arturs**.

I was born in Riga, Latvia. By the time I got to college in Washington, DC I had the opportunity to live in 8 different cities, 6 different countries, and learned English (:thumbsup:), French (:thumbsup:), Russian (:five:/:keycap_ten:), and German (:three:/:keycap_ten:).

I graduated from The George Washington University School business where I got a [Bachelor's in Business Administration](https://business.gwu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/bba) concentrating in finance and information systems, a [Masters of Science in Information Systems Technology](https://business.gwu.edu/academics/programs/specialized-masters/msist), and a [Certificate in Data Science](https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/) from the GW Columbian College of Arts & Sciences. Because you know...all that matters is where you went to college. :smiley:

Currently I work at <a href="www.anant.us" target="_blank">Anant</a> in the Georgetown area of Washington, DC where I help our team with business analysis, project management, and little bit of product management for our open-source framework, <a href="https://github.com/Appleseed" target="_blank">Appleseed</a>.
